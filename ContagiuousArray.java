/*525. Contiguous Array
 * Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
 * Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

 TimeComplexity:-O(n)
 SpaceComplexity:-O(n)
 Approach:- Whenever element at an index is 0 then we are subtracting 1 from running sum(rSum) and adding 1 to it when the element at an index is 1.Using a HashMap to store the first occurrence of each rSum and index.If the same rSum appears again, it means the subarray between those indices has a balanced number of 0s and 1s (i.e., net sum = 0).Only store the first time each rSum appears to ensure longest length.

            // If current number is 0, treat it as -1 in rSum
